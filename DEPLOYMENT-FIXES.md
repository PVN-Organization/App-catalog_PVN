# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow Error
**Problem:** 
- Workflow failed at "Setup Node.js" step
- Error: `Dependencies lock file is not found in /home/runner/work/App-catalog_PVN/App-catalog_PVN`
- Node.js setup was trying to cache npm dependencies but no `package-lock.json` existed

**Solution:**
- Removed `cache: 'npm'` from Node.js setup in workflow
- Added `.npmrc` file with `legacy-peer-deps=true`
- Updated workflow to use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

### 2. Dependency Conflict
**Problem:**
- `react-chartjs-2@5.2.0` requires `chart.js@^4.1.1`
- Project was using `chart.js@^4.5.0`
- NPM ERESOLVE error preventing installation

**Solution:**
- Updated `chart.js` version from `^4.5.0` to `^4.4.4` in `package.json`
- Added `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to npm install commands
- Created `.npmrc` file to make this setting persistent

### 3. Docker Build Issues
**Problem:**
- Docker build was failing due to npm dependency conflicts

**Solution:**
- Updated Dockerfile to use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- Ensured `.npmrc` file is copied to container during build

## Files Modified

### 1. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
```yaml
# Before
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18'
    cache: 'npm'
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install

# After
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18'
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. `Dockerfile`
```dockerfile
# Before
RUN npm install

# After
RUN npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 3. `package.json`
```json
// Before
"chart.js": "^4.5.0"

// After
"chart.js": "^4.4.4"
```

### 4. `.npmrc` (New file)
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
```

## Testing Results

### Local Testing
✅ Docker build successful
✅ Container starts without errors
✅ Health check endpoint responds correctly
✅ Application accessible on http://localhost:10002

### Expected GitHub Actions Results
✅ Test job should now pass on ubuntu-latest
✅ Build-and-deploy job should work on self-hosted runner
✅ Dependencies will install without conflicts
✅ Docker image will build successfully

## Deployment Flow

1. **Test Job (GitHub-hosted runner)**
   - Checkout code
   - Setup Node.js 18
   - Install dependencies with --legacy-peer-deps
   - Run tests (if any)
   - Build application

2. **Build-and-Deploy Job (Self-hosted runner ATM-5500721-01)**
   - Checkout code
   - Create backup of current deployment
   - Stop existing container
   - Build new Docker image
   - Start new container
   - Health check with auto-rollback
   - Cleanup old resources

## Next Steps

1. Commit these changes to the repository
2. Push to main branch to trigger workflow
3. Monitor GitHub Actions for successful deployment
4. Verify application is accessible at http://171.244.49.215:10002

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Auto-rollback is built into the workflow
2. Manual rollback using: `./scripts/deploy-selfhosted.sh rollback`
3. Or restore from Docker backup created during deployment

## Monitoring

- Health check runs every 15 minutes via GitHub Actions
- Manual health check: `curl http://171.244.49.215:10002/health`
- Container logs: `docker logs catalog-app`
- Container status: `docker ps --filter name=catalog-app`
